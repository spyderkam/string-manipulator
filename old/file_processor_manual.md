## Text Class

The `Text` class takes in string data and gives out needed data.

### Finding Strings

The `find_string` method returns a tuple of the number of times a word of interest appears in a text as well as the starting position of the first charachter of that word.

<!--# https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/read-file-as-string-in-python-->
```python
text = string_manipulator.Text(input_text)
finder = text.find_string
```

Here, applying `finder(word)[0]` will return the number of times `word` appears in the inputted string and `finder(word)[1]` will return the starting positions of the first charachter of `word` in input string. <br>

### Dividing Large Files Into $n$ Smaller Files

The `divide_by_lines` method of the `Text` class divides the input file into a desired amount of smaller files. It can make the output files into any desired extension.

```python
with open("big.txt", "r") as f:
    all_file_lines = f.readlines()

all_file_lines = [lines.replace("\n", '') for lines in all_file_lines]
all_lines = Text(all_file_lines)
all_lines.divide_by_lines(No_lines=len(all_file_lines), divfiles=12, folder='nfiles', ext='dat')
```

`No_lines` is the number of lines in the input files and $n =$ `divfiles` is the number of files the input file will be divided into. The new files will be named `ùö§_file.extension` where `ùö§` starts from `0`. Each file will have an equal amount of lines in it *but* the <ins>last file</ins> created *might* be longer than its preceding files depending on `No_lines % divfiles`. <br>

### Splitting Large Files Into Files Containing a Maxed Out Number of Lines

To split a file into smaller file where each file has no more than a certain amount of lines in it use the `split_by_lines` method of the `Text` class. 

```python
file = Text(inputFile)
file.split_by_lines(divlines, ext, folder)
```

`divlines` is the *maximum* number of lines in the newly created files, `ext` is the extension of the new files, and `folder` is the directory which they will be stored in. The last generated file might have less than `divlines` depending on the number of lines in the input file. The newly created files will be dubbed as `splittedFile_ùö§.ext` where `ùö§` starts from `0`. <br>

### Split Large Files Into Smaller Files by Size

To split files by the size of their size, call the `split_by_size` method. 

```python
file = Text(input_file)
file.split_by_size(size, ext, folder, fname)
```
`size` is the size of the output files in bytes, `ext` is the extension of both the input and output files, and `folder` is the directory which the *output files* will be stored in. If `folder` does not exist then the program will create it. The new files will be named `fname_ùö§.ext` where `ùö§` starts from `0`. <br>


## ExSpread Class

This class is for manipulating data <!--to and/or from spreadsheets.--> related to `logger_tac_ùö•.ascii_out` files (where `ùö•` could be any number, etc.). `ExSpread` takes in the file path as a string and an *optional* parameter which is used for searching. Although the name is misleading, `ExSpread` was originally only supposed to be related to spreadsheets; (Ex)cel (Spread)sheet.

### Extracting Timestamps From Files and Writing Them to Spreadsheets

The `mk_timesheet` method of this class was written with the purpose of extract timestamps from lines beneath certain strings in `.ascii_out` files (although it will work with other file types).

```python
inFile = ExSpread("path/to/file", "string to be searched")
inFile.mk_timesheet(folder, fname)
```
The path to the directory of the output file is `folder` and `fname` is the name of the output spreadsheet which is of type `.CSV`.

### Extracting URN Messages

To extract all messages *sent* from a specific Unique Reference Number (URN), use the `find_URN_messages` method of `ExSpread` as it will write them all to a `.dat` file.

```python
inFile = ExSpread("path/to/file", URN)
inFile.find_URN_messages(folder, fname)
```
where `folder` and `fname` follow as they did in the `mk_timesheet` method of this class. Note that `URN` can be entered either as a string or integer.
